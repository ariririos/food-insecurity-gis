# Visualization
[ ] Figure out how to make it clearer/less cluttered
[ ] Filtering and layers
    [ ] Select individual layers
    [ ] Select individual food sources (and show all paths from households)
    [ ] Select individual households (and show all paths to food sources)
[ ] Heatmaps
    [ ] As separate option
[ ] 3D??
[!] Distance-based heatmap
    [ ] easeIn function for distance since city center is particularly close to food sources (not a linear relationship)
[ ] Better differentiation
    [ ] Some ways should be emphasized (probably 441, 70, 98, 710, 78)
[ ] Is there a way to detect what households are within the viewing frame and only calculate distances/paths for those?
    [ ] Looks like the heatmap is already based just on which households are within the viewing frame: can we set boundaries (like county line)?
[ ] Pathfinding
    [ ] Introduce a randomness into which path is chosen by similar next node distances
    [ ] Weight major paths to be chosen less randomly (e.g. 441, 70, 98)
    [!] see grace's messages on Pathfinding
[ ] Ways and polygons display
    [ ] am I displaying MultiPolygons and MultiLineStrings correctly?
# Graphs
[ ] Rasterize households into neighborhoods or by no. of units
    [ ] Figure out visualization for rasterized households

# Data
[ ] Quality of food source metric
[ ] Data for households:
    [ ] Private mobility
    [ ] Poverty/income
    [ ] SNAP eligibility
    [ ] Free and Reduced Lunch usage
    [ ] Demographics (race, language)
    [ ] Migrant farmworker children population
    [ ] Family size
[ ] Data for food sources:
    [ ] (^) food quality metric
    [ ] Hours
    [ ] Selection
    [ ] Price range
[ ] Get names/addresses of all buildings
    [ ] Tooltips over individual buildings/areas to show name/address
[ ] pixels per meter per degree
[ ] meters per degree
    [ ] spherical geometry equation
[ ] data cleaning tool - getClosestFeatureToCursor
[ ] Heatmap 
    [ ] discrete score per distance to food source
[ ] data input
    [ ] give the schools the ability to input the students' data
[ ] stat analysis
    [ ] matching f(x, y) to a student and seeing if they're above some "food insecure" threshold
    [ ] fuzzy it a bit to keep it anonymous
[ ] population change layer
    [ ] block and block group population change
    [ ] government assistance block group changes
    [ ] income block group changes
[!] filter down blockgroups.geojson to just chobee cause it's way too many MB rn

# Code
[ ] Eventual conversion to p5.js or some java -> js stuff
